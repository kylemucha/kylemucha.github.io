    <h1>The Enjoyment of Cars</h1>
    <p>The topic of my choice is <strong>Cars!</strong>. I chose to make this webpage about cars because I have always found interst
    in the uniqueness to each car and also how anyone can personalize there car to their own enjoyment. I also found an interest in cars
    from watching different movies such as <strong>Fast & Furious, Trasnformers, and Disney's Cars</strong>. I was always interested in the
    visuals of the car but also how they can be created and improved upon to increase performance and speed. I was also interested in the idea
    of drifting as it takes lots of practice and skill to have control over a vehicle like that to be able to drift. <a href=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/top-gear-advice/these-are-10-best-japanese-performance-cars>More awesome cars could be found here!</a>
